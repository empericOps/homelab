#Documentation

I don't expect this to be the neatest thing. I'm learning this as I go with some resources so I thought it would be beneficial to provide 
them as I go.
Essentially, my goal is to create a homelab using K8S nodes to learn how kubernetes works and the process of creating yaml for IaC and improving my skills as both a SysEngineer/SysAdmin.

I want to be able to host my own things internally (like most internet geeks) and be able to toy with some side projects without worrying too much about: "Do I have the VM space to do this?" I also feel like I can't toy as much as I used to be able to in my day-job, unfortunately, I can't push everything to prod.


	#Video Resources Used:
	
	So far: I've used a few videos on Youtube to help set up my K8S controller and nodes. I have no idea what I'm doing but shoutout to 
	Learn Linux TV and his guide regarding using K8S on proxmox.

	Also checking out Mischa van den burg on Youtube; following a lot of his steps and learning them as I go on what is worthwhile.
